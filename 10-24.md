# Owner Portal Updates - October 24, 2025

## Summary

1. Removed unnecessary pages from the Owner Portal to align with the simplified navigation structure
2. Removed percentage display from Application Pipeline Breakdown cards
3. Added required reason field for bulk agency deletion

---

## 1. Owner Portal Cleanup

### Deleted Pages

- **src/pages/OwnerSettings.jsx** - Removed settings page
- **src/pages/OwnerUsers.jsx** - Removed users management page

### Updated Routing (src/App.jsx)

- Removed `/owner/users` route definition
- Removed `/owner/settings` route definition
- Cleaned up imports for `OwnerUsers` and `OwnerSettings` components

### Updated Navigation (src/components/OwnerLayout.jsx)

- Removed "Users" navigation item from sidebar
- Removed "Settings" navigation item from sidebar
- Cleaned up unused icon imports (`Users` and `Settings` from lucide-react)

### Final Owner Portal Structure

The Owner Portal now has a clean, focused navigation with only three main sections:

```
/owner/login (public)
├── /owner/dashboard (protected)
├── /owner/agencies (protected)
└── /owner/analytics (protected)
    └── /owner/analytics/:agencyId (protected - agency details)
```

#### Sidebar Navigation

1. **Dashboard** - Overview metrics and statistics
2. **Agency Management** - View and manage all agencies
3. **Analytics** - Detailed analytics and agency-specific insights

#### Additional UI Elements

- Language switcher
- Theme toggle (dark/light mode)
- User profile display
- Logout button

### Rationale

This cleanup aligns with the Owner Portal specification which defines the portal as a **view-only monitoring/oversight system** with limited administrative actions. The owner's primary functions are:

- Monitor aggregate metrics
- View agency details
- Perform basic agency management (activate/deactivate/delete)
- Analyze performance data

User management and system settings are not part of the core owner responsibilities in this implementation.

## 2. Pipeline Breakdown UI Update

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/pages/OwnerAgencyDetails.jsx`

- Removed percentage display from Application Pipeline Breakdown cards
- Cards now only show the count of applicants in each stage
- Removed the line: `<p className="text-xs opacity-80">{stage.percentage}% of total</p>`

### Before

```
Applied
145
100% of total
```

### After

```
Applied
145
```

### Rationale

Simplified the UI to focus on absolute numbers rather than percentages, making the cards cleaner and easier to read at a glance.

## 3. Unified Agency Deletion Flow with Reason Requirement

### Changes Made

#### Updated ConfirmationDialog Component

**Files:**

- `src/components/agencies/ConfirmationDialog.jsx` (standalone component)
- `src/pages/OwnerAgencies.jsx` (local ConfirmationDialog component)

**Changes:**

- Added `deleteReason` and `setDeleteReason` props
- Unified both deletion methods (individual delete and bulk delete) to use the same confirmation dialog
- Added dynamic validation based on number of agencies being deleted
- Added textarea field for entering deletion reason (required for all deletions)
- Added confirmation text input field (type "DELETE" for 1 agency, "DELETE ALL" for multiple)
- Delete button is disabled until both fields are properly filled

#### Updated OwnerAgencies Page

**File:** `src/pages/OwnerAgencies.jsx`

- Added `deleteReason` state variable
- Modified `handleDelete` function to use "bulkDelete" type instead of "delete" type
- Both individual and bulk delete now use the same confirmation flow
- Reset `confirmText` and `deleteReason` when opening or closing dialogs
- Updated `confirmDelete` function to work with the new unified flow

#### Updated Translation Files

**Files:**

- `public/translations/en/pages/owner-agencies.json`
- `public/translations/ne/pages/owner-agencies.json`

**Added new translation keys:**

- `confirmDialog.bulkDelete.titleSingle` - "Delete Agency"
- `confirmDialog.bulkDelete.messageSingle` - Message for single agency deletion
- `confirmDialog.bulkDelete.reasonPlaceholderSingle` - Placeholder for single agency
- `confirmDialog.bulkDelete.typeToConfirmSingle` - "Type DELETE to confirm"
- `confirmDialog.bulkDelete.confirmPlaceholderSingle` - "DELETE"
- `confirmDialog.bulkDelete.confirmSingle` - "Delete" button text

### Behavior

**Deleting 1 Agency (any method):**

- Title: "Delete Agency"
- Message: "Are you sure you want to delete '[Agency Name]'? This action cannot be undone."
- Field 1: **Reason for deletion** (textarea) - Required
  - Placeholder: "Please provide a reason for deleting this agency..."
- Field 2: **Type DELETE to confirm** (input) - Required
  - Must type exactly: `DELETE`
- Button: "Delete" (disabled until both fields are valid)

**Deleting 2+ Agencies (bulk selection):**

- Title: "Delete Multiple Agencies"
- Message: "Are you sure you want to delete X agencies? This action cannot be undone."
- Field 1: **Reason for deletion** (textarea) - Required
  - Placeholder: "Please provide a reason for deleting multiple agencies..."
- Field 2: **Type DELETE ALL to confirm** (input) - Required
  - Must type exactly: `DELETE ALL`
- Button: "Delete All" (disabled until both fields are valid)

**Both methods show:**

- Hint: "This action will be logged for audit purposes."

### Rationale

**Unified UI/UX:**

- Consistent deletion experience across all deletion methods
- Reduces user confusion by having one standard deletion flow
- Maintains professional appearance with consistent interactions

**Enhanced Security & Accountability:**

- All deletions require a reason (logged for audit purposes)
- Confirmation text prevents accidental deletions
- Provides audit trail for administrative actions
- Different confirmation text ("DELETE" vs "DELETE ALL") based on severity

**Grammar & Context Awareness:**

- Dynamic text based on number of agencies being deleted
- Singular vs plural grammar handled automatically
- Shows agency name when deleting a single agency
- Shows count when deleting multiple agencies

- Added dynamic validation based on action type (activate vs deactivate)
- Added textarea field for entering reason (required for all status changes)
- Added confirmation text input field (type "ACTIVATE" or "DEACTIVATE" for 1 agency, "ACTIVATE ALL" or "DEACTIVATE ALL" for multiple)
- Button text changes dynamically based on action and count

#### Updated OwnerAgencies Page

**File:** `src/pages/OwnerAgencies.jsx`

- Modified `handleStatusChange` function to use "statusChange" type for both single and bulk operations

- `confirmDialog.statusChange.titleSingle` - "{{action}} Agency"
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.messageSingle` - Message for single agency
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.reasonLabel` - "Reason for status change"
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.reasonPlaceholder` - Placeholder for multiple agencies
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.reasonPlaceholderSingle` - Placeholder for single agency
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.typeToConfirm` - "Type {{action}} ALL to confirm"
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.typeToConfirmSingle` - "Type {{action}} to confirm"
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.confirmPlaceholder` - "{{action}} ALL"
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.confirmPlaceholderSingle` - "{{action}}"
- `confirmDialog.statusChange.confirmSingle` - "{{action}}"

### Behavior

**Activating/Deactivating 1 Agency:**

- Title: "Activate Agency" or "Deactivate Agency"
- Message: "Are you sure you want to activate/deactivate '[Agency Name]'?"
- Field 1: **Reason for status change** (textarea) - Required
  - Placeholder: "Please provide a reason for activating/deactivating this agency..."
- Field 2: **Type ACTIVATE or DEACTIVATE to confirm** (input) - Required

### Rationale

**Consistent Administrative Actions:**

- All critical administrative actions (delete, activate, deactivate) now follow the same pattern
- Users learn one interaction model that applies to all actions
- Reduces cognitive load and potential for errors

**Enhanced Accountability:**

- Status changes are now tracked with reasons
- Prevents arbitrary status changes without justification
- Provides complete audit trail for all administrative actions
- Helps with compliance and oversight requirements

**Action-Specific Confirmation:**

- Different confirmation text based on action type (ACTIVATE vs DEACTIVATE)
- Clear distinction between activating and deactivating
- Prevents confusion when performing bulk operations

## 5. Auto-Refresh for Owner Portal Pages

### Changes Made

#### Updated OwnerLayout Component

**File:** `src/components/OwnerLayout.jsx`

**Changes:**

- Added auto-refresh functionality that triggers every 2 minutes
- Dispatches a custom `ownerPageRefresh` event that pages can listen to
- Added `onRefresh` callback prop for additional refresh handling
- Uses `setInterval` to trigger refresh at 2-minute intervals
- Properly cleans up interval on component unmount

#### Updated Owner Portal Pages

**Files:**

- `src/pages/OwnerDashboard.jsx`
- `src/pages/OwnerAgencies.jsx`
- `src/pages/OwnerAnalytics.jsx`

**Changes:**

- Added event listeners for `ownerPageRefresh` custom event
- Each page reloads its data when the event is triggered
- OwnerAgencies also reloads detail panel if open
- Proper cleanup of event listeners on unmount

### Behavior

**Auto-Refresh Interval:** Every 2 minutes (120,000ms)

**Pages that auto-refresh:**

- `/owner/dashboard` - Reloads statistics and recent activity
- `/owner/agencies` - Reloads agency list, platform stats, and detail panel (if open)
- `/owner/analytics` - Reloads agency list and analytics data

**Pages that DO NOT auto-refresh:**

- `/owner/login` - Login page is excluded from auto-refresh

**Console Logging:**

- Each page logs when it auto-refreshes for debugging purposes
- Format: `[PageName] Auto-refreshing data...`

### Rationale

**Real-Time Data:**

- Owner portal displays critical business metrics that need to be current
- Auto-refresh ensures data is never more than 2 minutes old
- Reduces need for manual page refreshes

**User Experience:**

- Seamless updates without user intervention
- No interruption to user's workflow
- Data stays fresh while user is viewing the portal

**Performance:**

- 2-minute interval balances freshness with server load
- Only refreshes data, not the entire page
- Event-based architecture allows pages to control their own refresh logic

**Excluded Login Page:**

- Login page doesn't need auto-refresh as it's a one-time action
- Prevents unnecessary API calls on the login screen
- Auto-refresh only activates after successful authentication

### Manual Refresh Button

**Added to:** `src/components/OwnerLayout.jsx`

**Features:**

- Refresh icon button (RefreshCw from lucide-react) placed next to language and theme toggles
- Clicking the button immediately triggers a data refresh
- Shows spinning animation while refreshing (1 second)
- Button is disabled during refresh to prevent multiple simultaneous refreshes
- Tooltip shows "Refresh data" (bilingual support)
- Available on all owner portal pages: `/owner/dashboard`, `/owner/agencies`, `/owner/analytics`

**Translation Keys Added:**

- English: `nav.refresh` - "Refresh data"
- Nepali: `nav.refresh` - "डाटा रिफ्रेस गर्नुहोस्"

**User Experience:**

- Users can manually refresh data anytime without waiting for the 2-minute auto-refresh
- Visual feedback with spinning icon during refresh
- Consistent placement across all owner portal pages

## 6. Locale Reload Persistence Fix (October 27, 2025)

### Problem

When the browser was reloaded (Ctrl+R or F5) with Nepali language selected, the application would show English content instead of maintaining the Nepali language selection. This happened despite the language preference being saved in localStorage.

### Root Cause

The issue was a **race condition** in the initialization sequence:

1. `I18nService` constructor initialized with hardcoded `this.currentLocale = 'en'`
2. React components started rendering with this default English locale
3. The `init()` method would later detect the saved Nepali preference from localStorage
4. By the time the locale was corrected, users had already seen English content

**Before (Problematic Code):**
```javascript
constructor() {
  this.currentLocale = 'en'  // ❌ Hardcoded default
  // ... other initialization
}

init() {
  const detectedLocale = this.detectLocale()  // Finds 'ne' in storage
  this.setLocale(detectedLocale)  // Too late - components already rendered
}
```

### Solution

Moved locale detection into the constructor using a new `detectLocaleEarly()` method that runs **before** any components render.

#### Changes Made

**File:** `src/services/i18nService.js`

1. **Modified Constructor:**
   ```javascript
   constructor() {
     // Initialize storage keys first
     this.storageKey = 'udaan-sarathi-locale'
     this.preferenceVersion = '1.1.0'
     this.fallbackLocale = 'en'
     
     // ✅ Detect locale BEFORE setting currentLocale
     const detectedLocale = this.detectLocaleEarly()
     this.currentLocale = detectedLocale  // Now uses saved preference
     
     // ... rest of initialization
   }
   ```

2. **Added `detectLocaleEarly()` Method:**
   ```javascript
   detectLocaleEarly() {
     try {
       // Check new storage format
       const stored = localStorage.getItem(this.storageKey)
       if (stored) {
         const preference = JSON.parse(stored)
         if (preference?.locale && ['en', 'ne'].includes(preference.locale)) {
           return preference.locale
         }
       }
       
       // Check legacy format
       const legacyStored = localStorage.getItem('preferred-locale')
       if (legacyStored && ['en', 'ne'].includes(legacyStored)) {
         return legacyStored
       }
     } catch (error) {
       console.warn('Early locale detection failed:', error)
     }
     
     return 'en'  // Safe fallback
   }
   ```

3. **Updated `init()` Method:**
   ```javascript
   init() {
     // ... setup code
     
     const detectedLocale = this.detectLocale()
     
     // Only update if different from constructor detection
     if (detectedLocale !== this.currentLocale) {
       this.setLocale(detectedLocale, false)
     } else {
       // Just ensure document attributes are set
       document.documentElement.lang = this.currentLocale
       document.documentElement.dir = this.isRTL(this.currentLocale) ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'
     }
     
     // ... rest of initialization
   }
   ```

**File:** `src/contexts/LanguageContext.jsx`

- Updated `useState` to use lazy initialization:
  ```javascript
  const [locale, setLocaleState] = useState(() => i18nService.getLocale())
  ```
- Added sync check after init to ensure state matches service
- Removed unused `previousLocale` parameter from subscription callback

### Behavior

**Before Fix:**
```
1. Constructor: currentLocale = 'en' (hardcoded)
2. React renders components with 'en'
3. User sees English content
4. init() called
5. detectLocale() finds 'ne' in storage
6. setLocale('ne') called
7. React re-renders with 'ne'
8. User sees language switch (bad UX)
```

**After Fix:**
```
1. Constructor: detectLocaleEarly() finds 'ne' in storage
2. Constructor: currentLocale = 'ne' (from storage)
3. React renders components with 'ne'
4. User sees Nepali content immediately
5. init() called
6. detectLocale() confirms 'ne'
7. No change needed
8. User sees consistent Nepali (good UX)
```

### Testing

**Automated Verification:**
Created `verify-locale-reload-fix.js` which tests:
- ✅ Fresh start defaults to English
- ✅ Nepali selection persists across reloads
- ✅ English selection persists across reloads
- ✅ Legacy storage format support
- ✅ Corrupted storage fallback

All tests pass successfully!

**Manual Testing Steps:**
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Switch language to Nepali using the language toggle
3. Verify UI shows Nepali text
4. Reload the page (Ctrl+R or F5)
5. **Expected**: Page loads directly in Nepali, no flash of English
6. Switch to English and repeat
7. **Expected**: Page loads directly in English

**Browser Testing:**
Open `test-locale-reload-fix.html` for an interactive test

### Benefits

1. **Immediate Locale Detection**: Locale is detected before any rendering
2. **No Flash of Wrong Language**: Components render with correct language from start
3. **Persistent Across Reloads**: Language selection survives all types of page reloads
4. **Backward Compatible**: Still supports legacy `preferred-locale` storage
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles corrupted storage data
6. **Better User Experience**: No jarring language switches on page load

### Rationale

**User Experience:**
- Users expect their language selection to persist across sessions
- Seeing a flash of the wrong language is jarring and unprofessional
- Immediate locale detection provides a seamless experience

**Technical Correctness:**
- Locale should be part of the initial application state, not a side effect
- Constructor is the right place for synchronous initialization
- Separates concerns: early detection (constructor) vs. full initialization (init)

**Reliability:**
- Handles edge cases (corrupted storage, missing data)
- Backward compatible with legacy storage format
- Graceful fallback to English if detection fails

### Files Modified

- `src/services/i18nService.js` - Added early locale detection
- `src/contexts/LanguageContext.jsx` - Updated to use lazy initialization

### Files Created

- `verify-locale-reload-fix.js` - Automated verification script
- `test-locale-reload-fix.html` - Interactive browser test
- `LOCALE_RELOAD_FIX.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `10-27-locale-fix.md` - Summary documentation

### Status

✅ **FIXED** - Locale now persists correctly across page reloads

The language selection now sticks to the user's choice (English or Nepali) until they explicitly change it through the language toggle, regardless of page reloads or browser refreshes.
