What I implemented for the dark theme centralization:
1. Theme Context (UdaanSarathi/src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx)
Created a React context to manage theme state globally
Handles system preference detection
Provides theme switching functionality
Persists theme choice in localStorage
2. Theme Toggle Component (UdaanSarathi/src/components/ThemeToggle.jsx)
Interactive button to switch between light and dark modes
Uses Sun/Moon icons for visual feedback
Accessible with proper ARIA labels
3. Updated Tailwind Configuration (UdaanSarathi/tailwind.config.js)
Enabled class-based dark mode with darkMode: 'class'
4. Comprehensive CSS Updates (UdaanSarathi/src/index.css)
Added dark mode variants for all UI components:
Cards, buttons, form elements
Chips, loading states
Interactive elements
Updated color schemes for dark theme
5. Interactive Components Dark Mode (UdaanSarathi/src/styles/interactive.css)
Updated all interactive UI components with dark mode support
Enhanced hover states, modals, dropdowns for dark theme
6. Layout Integration (UdaanSarathi/src/components/Layout.jsx)
Added ThemeProvider to App.jsx
Integrated theme toggle in navigation
Updated all layout styling for dark mode
7. Theme Hook (UdaanSarathi/src/hooks/useTheme.js)
Utility hook for easy theme access in components
8. Documentation (UdaanSarathi/src/docs/DARK_THEME_GUIDE.md)
Comprehensive guide for using and extending the dark theme system
The task from task11.md was to "centralize dark theme on app so that it support on dark theme through out the project" - and that's exactly what I implemented. The dark theme is now centralized and works throughout the entire application.

Would you like me to create a du9.md file with a summary of this implementation, or did you have something else in mind?
