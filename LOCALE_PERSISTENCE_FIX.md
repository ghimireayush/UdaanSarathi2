# Locale Persistence Fix - Nepali Language Revert Issue

## Problem
When users selected Nepali language and then refreshed the page (using Ctrl+R or browser refresh button), the language would revert back to English instead of persisting the Nepali selection.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `validateLocale()` method in `src/services/i18nService.js`. The method was checking if the locale exists in the `this.translations` Map, but this check was too strict and could fail during initialization timing issues.

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Too strict validation
validateLocale(locale) {
  if (!locale || typeof locale !== 'string') {
    return false
  }
  
  // This check could fail during initialization
  if (!this.translations.has(locale)) {
    return false
  }
  
  const localePattern = /^[a-z]{2}(-[A-Z]{2})?$/
  return localePattern.test(locale)
}
```

## Solution
Modified the `validateLocale()` method to use a hardcoded list of supported locales instead of checking the translations Map. This ensures validation works correctly even during initialization before all translations are fully loaded.

```javascript
// NEW CODE - More reliable validation
validateLocale(locale) {
  if (!locale || typeof locale !== 'string') {
    return false
  }
  
  // Basic format validation first
  const localePattern = /^[a-z]{2}(-[A-Z]{2})?$/
  if (!localePattern.test(locale)) {
    return false
  }
  
  // Use hardcoded list of supported locales
  const supportedLocales = ['en', 'ne']
  if (!supportedLocales.includes(locale)) {
    return false
  }
  
  return true
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `validateLocale()` method
- Changed validation to use hardcoded list of supported locales
- Reordered checks to validate format before checking supported locales
- This ensures the method works reliably during initialization

### 2. Improved Validation Logic
The validation logic now:
- Checks format first before checking supported locales
- Uses a hardcoded list of supported locales for reliability
- Works correctly during initialization before translations are fully loaded

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Switch language to Nepali (नेपाली)
3. Verify the UI shows Nepali text
4. Press Ctrl+R or click browser refresh button
5. Verify the language remains Nepali after refresh

### Test File
A test file `test-locale-persistence.html` has been created to verify the fix:
1. Open `test-locale-persistence.html` in a browser
2. Click "Set to Nepali" button
3. The page will reload automatically
4. Verify the test shows "SUCCESS: Locale persisted after refresh!"

## Technical Details

### Locale Storage Mechanism
The i18nService uses a multi-layered storage approach:
1. **localStorage** - Primary storage (persists across sessions)
2. **sessionStorage** - Fallback storage (persists during session)
3. **In-memory** - Final fallback (lost on refresh)

### Storage Format
```json
{
  "locale": "ne",
  "timestamp": 1730000000000,
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "checksum": "abc123"
}
```

### Validation Process
1. Check localStorage for preference
2. Parse and validate preference structure
3. Validate locale code format and support
4. Check timestamp (expire after 30 days)
5. Verify version compatibility
6. Return validated locale or null

## Files Modified
- `src/services/i18nService.js` - Fixed validateLocale() method and added debug logging

## Files Created
- `test-locale-persistence.html` - Test file to verify the fix
- `LOCALE_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Verification
After the fix, when you refresh the page with Nepali selected:
1. The language should remain Nepali (not revert to English)
2. The UI should display Nepali text immediately on page load
3. No console errors related to locale detection should appear

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding a UI indicator showing locale persistence status
2. Add automated tests for locale persistence
3. Consider adding locale preference sync across multiple devices
4. Add user notification when locale preference expires (after 30 days)
