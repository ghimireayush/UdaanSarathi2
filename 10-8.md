## Issues Fixed

### TypeScript Configuration Error in jsconfig.json

**Problem**: 
- TypeScript was showing errors in jsconfig.json related to React type definitions
- Error indicated TypeScript couldn't find React types despite @types/react being installed in devDependencies
- Configuration was too strict for a JavaScript project using JSDoc-style type checking

**Root Cause**:
- jsconfig.json had overly strict TypeScript settings (`strict: true`) inappropriate for JS projects
- Explicit `types` array was conflicting with auto-discovery of type definitions
- Missing proper `typeRoots` configuration to point to installed type definitions

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Removed problematic settings**:
   - Removed `strict: true` (too restrictive for JavaScript projects)
   - Removed explicit `types` array to allow auto-discovery

2. **Added proper TypeScript configuration**:
   - Added `typeRoots: ["./node_modules/@types"]` to explicitly point to type definitions
   - Added `noEmit: true` since this is a JS project (no TypeScript compilation needed)
   - Added `allowImportingTsExtensions: false` to prevent mixed JS/TS import issues

3. **Improved path mapping**:
   - Changed path mapping from `"*": ["./src/*"]` to `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` for better convention
   - More specific and less likely to cause conflicts

**Verification**:
- Confirmed @types/react and @types/react-dom are properly installed (v18.3.26 and v18.3.7)
- Ran diagnostics on jsconfig.json - no errors found
- Tested React components (Layout.jsx, InteractiveNotification.jsx) - no TypeScript errors

**Result**: 
- TypeScript errors in jsconfig.json resolved
- React type definitions now properly recognized
- Configuration optimized for Vite + React JavaScript project with TypeScript intellisense support

## Files Modified
- `jsconfig.json` - Updated TypeScript configuration for JavaScript project compatibility

## Technical Notes
- Project uses JavaScript with JSDoc-style type checking, not full TypeScript
- Vite bundler with React 18.2.0
- TypeScript 5.9.3 installed for development tooling and intellisense only
