# Generated Types Directory

⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY MANUALLY**

This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript types from the backend OpenAPI specification.

## Files

- `types.ts` - Main generated types file (auto-generated)
- `index.ts` - Barrel export file (auto-generated)

## Generation

Types are generated automatically by running:

```bash
npm run generate:types
```

Or in watch mode during development:

```bash
npm run generate:types:watch
```

## Source of Truth

The backend OpenAPI specification at `/docs-yaml` is the single source of truth.
Any changes to backend DTOs will be reflected here after regeneration.

## Usage

Import types using the `@api/generated` path alias:

```typescript
import type { paths, components } from '@api/generated';
```

Or use type helpers for convenience:

```typescript
import type { RequestBody, Response } from '@api/types/helpers';
```
