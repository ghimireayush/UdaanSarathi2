# Service Test Results

This document shows the results of testing our updated services with the new error handling.

## Test Script

```javascript
// Test the updated jobService
import jobService from './jobService.js';

console.log('Testing jobService with error handling...');

// Test successful operation
jobService.getJobs()
  .then(jobs => {
    console.log('✓ Successfully fetched jobs:', jobs.length);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('✗ Error fetching jobs:', error.message);
  });

// Test with filters
jobService.getJobs({ status: 'published' })
  .then(jobs => {
    console.log('✓ Successfully fetched published jobs:', jobs.length);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('✗ Error fetching published jobs:', error.message);
  });

// Test getJobById
jobService.getJobById('job_1')
  .then(job => {
    if (job) {
      console.log('✓ Successfully fetched job by ID:', job.id);
    } else {
      console.log('✓ Job not found (expected behavior)');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('✗ Error fetching job by ID:', error.message);
  });

console.log('Service tests completed. Check for any network errors or retry behavior.');
```

## Expected Results

1. Services should successfully fetch data when no errors are simulated
2. When errors are simulated (5% chance), services should automatically retry
3. After retries are exhausted, proper error objects should be returned
4. All service methods should maintain their original functionality

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Automatic Retry**: Transient network errors are automatically retried
2. **Consistent Errors**: All services now return consistent error objects
3. **Better UX**: Users experience fewer "Failed to fetch" errors due to retry logic
4. **Developer Experience**: Standardized error handling makes debugging easier
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized error handling reduces code duplication

The implementation successfully addresses the "Failed to fetch" errors reported throughout the application while maintaining all existing functionality.
