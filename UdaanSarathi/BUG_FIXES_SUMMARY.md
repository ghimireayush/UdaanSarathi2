# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **Maximum update depth exceeded** warnings in React components
2. **Navigation throttling** issues
3. **Duplicate authentication contexts** causing conflicts

## Root Cause
The application was using two different authentication contexts:
- `UserContext` (older, simpler implementation)
- `AuthContext` (newer, more comprehensive implementation)

This was causing infinite loops in the useEffect hooks because both contexts were trying to manage authentication state simultaneously.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed Duplicate Context
- Deleted `src/contexts/UserContext.jsx`
- Deleted `src/contexts/UserContext.test.js`
- Removed `UserProvider` from `src/main.jsx`

### 2. Updated Component Dependencies
- Updated `src/pages/Login.jsx` to use `useAuth` from `AuthContext` instead of `useUser` from `UserContext`
- Updated `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` to use `useAuth` from `AuthContext` instead of `useUser` from `UserContext`

### 3. Simplified Provider Hierarchy
- Modified `src/main.jsx` to only use `AuthProvider` instead of both `AuthProvider` and `UserProvider`

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the removal of `UserContext` from the project structure

## Verification
After implementing these changes:
1. The "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings are resolved
2. Navigation throttling issues are eliminated
3. The application functions correctly with proper authentication
4. The audit log feature is accessible only to admin users as intended
5. Navigation structure follows the specified order:
   - Dashboard
   - Jobs
   - Drafts
   - Applications
   - Interviews
   - Workflow
   - Audit Log (Admin Only)
   - Agency Settings

## Testing
The application was tested with:
- Admin user login and access to all features including Audit Log
- Recruiter user login with access to all features except Audit Log
- Coordinator user login with limited access as per permissions
- Navigation between all pages works correctly
- No infinite loops or performance issues observed

## Impact
These changes have improved the application's stability and performance while maintaining all existing functionality. The authentication system is now simpler and more reliable.
