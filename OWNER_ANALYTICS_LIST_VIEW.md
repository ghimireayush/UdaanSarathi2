# Owner Analytics List View Feature

## Overview
Added a list view option to the Owner Analytics page (`/owner/analytics`) to provide an alternative way to view agency data alongside the existing grid view.

## Changes Made

### 1. View Mode Toggle
- Added a toggle button in the top-right corner to switch between Grid and List views
- Toggle uses icons from Lucide React (`Grid3x3` and `List`)
- Active view is highlighted with blue accent color
- View preference is stored in component state

### 2. List View Component
Created a new `AgencyListItem` component that displays agencies in a horizontal card layout:

**Features:**
- Larger agency avatar (16x16 vs 12x12 in grid)
- Horizontal layout with all information in a single row
- Statistics displayed side-by-side with icons
- Larger, more prominent "View Details" button
- Better use of horizontal space on wider screens
- Hover effects for better interactivity

**Layout Structure:**
```
[Avatar] [Agency Name + License] [Active Jobs] [Applicants] [Team Members] [View Details Button]
```

### 3. Grid View (Existing)
Maintained the existing grid view with no changes:
- 4-column responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop, 4 xl screens)
- Compact card design
- Vertical layout

### 4. View Toggle UI
Located between "Results Summary" and the agency display:
- Left side: Results count
- Right side: Grid/List toggle buttons
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Dark mode support

## User Experience

### Grid View (Default)
- Best for: Quick scanning, comparing multiple agencies at once
- Shows: 12-96 agencies per page (configurable)
- Layout: Compact cards in responsive grid

### List View
- Best for: Detailed comparison, reading agency information
- Shows: Same pagination as grid view
- Layout: Full-width horizontal cards with more breathing room

## Technical Details

### State Management
```javascript
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState("grid"); // 'grid' or 'list'
```

### Conditional Rendering
```javascript
{viewMode === "grid" ? (
  <GridView />
) : (
  <ListView />
)}
```

### Icons Used
- `Grid3x3` - Grid view icon
- `List` - List view icon
- `Briefcase` - Active jobs
- `Users` - Applicants and team members
- `Eye` - View details action

## Responsive Design

### Grid View
- Mobile (< 768px): 1 column
- Tablet (768px - 1024px): 2 columns
- Desktop (1024px - 1280px): 3 columns
- XL (> 1280px): 4 columns

### List View
- All screen sizes: Full-width cards
- Statistics stack on smaller screens (handled by flex-wrap)
- Button remains visible on all screen sizes

## Accessibility

- Toggle buttons have descriptive titles
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly labels
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA color contrast

## Dark Mode Support

Both views fully support dark mode with appropriate color schemes:
- Background colors
- Text colors
- Border colors
- Hover states
- Active states

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Save view preference to localStorage
2. Add table view option
3. Add compact list view (smaller cards)
4. Add export functionality for list view
5. Add bulk actions in list view

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/OwnerAnalytics.jsx` - Added list view toggle and component

## Testing

1. Navigate to `/owner/login`
2. Login with owner credentials (`owner@udaan.com` / `owner123`)
3. Go to Analytics page (`/owner/analytics`)
4. Click the Grid/List toggle buttons
5. Verify both views display correctly
6. Test pagination in both views
7. Test filters and search in both views
8. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
9. Test dark mode in both views
