# Portal Isolation Fix - Owner Login Security

## Problem
Owners could potentially log in through the wrong portals (`/login` for agency admin or `/member/login` for team members), causing confusion and potential security issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Separate Login Methods in authService.js**

Created three distinct login methods with role validation:

- **`login(username, password)`** - Agency portal (admin only, NOT owners)
  - Validates user is admin role
  - Explicitly blocks owner accounts (`user_owner`, `owner@udaan.com`)
  - Error: "Owner accounts must use the Owner Portal at /owner/login"

- **`ownerLogin(email, password)`** - Owner portal (owners only)
  - Validates user is admin role AND is owner account
  - Checks for owner-specific identifiers
  - Sets `isOwner: true` flag in user data
  - Error: "This account does not have owner privileges. Please use the Agency Portal."

- **`memberLogin(username, password, invitationToken)`** - Member portal (recipients & coordinators only)
  - Validates user is recipient or coordinator role
  - Explicitly blocks admins and owners
  - Error: "Only team members (Recipients and Coordinators) can access this portal"

### 2. **AuthContext Updates**

Added `ownerLogin` method to AuthContext and exposed it to components:

```javascript
const ownerLogin = async (email, password) => {
  const result = await authService.ownerLogin(email, password)
  // Sets user, authentication state, permissions
  // Logs audit event with portal: 'owner'
}
```

### 3. **Login Page Redirects**

Updated all three login pages to prevent cross-portal access:

**Login.jsx** (`/login` - Agency Portal):
- Redirects authenticated owners to `/owner/dashboard`
- Shows error if owner tries to log in

**OwnerLogin.jsx** (`/owner/login` - Owner Portal):
- Uses `ownerLogin()` method instead of `login()`
- Redirects non-owners to `/dashboard` if already authenticated
- Only accepts owner accounts

**MemberLogin.jsx** (`/member/login` - Member Portal):
- Redirects authenticated owners to `/owner/dashboard`
- Shows error if owner/admin tries to log in

### 4. **User Data Flags**

Owner accounts now have an `isOwner: true` flag in their user data for easy identification:

```javascript
user: {
  id: 'user_owner',
  email: 'owner@udaan.com',
  role: 'admin',
  isOwner: true,  // ← New flag
  ...
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Owner tries to log in at `/login`
- **Expected**: Error message "Owner accounts must use the Owner Portal at /owner/login"
- **Result**: Login blocked, user redirected to correct portal

### ✅ Scenario 2: Owner tries to log in at `/member/login`
- **Expected**: Error message "Only team members can access this portal"
- **Result**: Login blocked, user redirected to correct portal

### ✅ Scenario 3: Owner logs in at `/owner/login`
- **Expected**: Successful login, redirect to `/owner/dashboard`
- **Result**: ✅ Works correctly

### ✅ Scenario 4: Admin tries to log in at `/owner/login`
- **Expected**: Error message "This account does not have owner privileges"
- **Result**: Login blocked, suggested to use Agency Portal

### ✅ Scenario 5: Member tries to log in at `/login`
- **Expected**: Error message "Only administrators can access this portal"
- **Result**: Login blocked

### ✅ Scenario 6: Member tries to log in at `/owner/login`
- **Expected**: Error message "Only platform owners can access this portal"
- **Result**: Login blocked

## Security Benefits

1. **Role-Based Portal Access**: Each portal only accepts specific user roles
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Users know exactly which portal to use
3. **Automatic Redirects**: Authenticated users are sent to their correct portal
4. **Audit Trail**: Each login method logs to audit with portal information
5. **No Cross-Contamination**: Owner sessions can't be used in agency/member portals

## Test Credentials

- **Owner Portal** (`/owner/login`):
  - Email: `owner@udaan.com`
  - Password: `owner123`

- **Agency Portal** (`/login`):
  - Email: `admin@udaan.com`
  - Password: `admin123`

- **Member Portal** (`/member/login`):
  - Email: `recipient@udaan.com` or `coordinator@udaan.com`
  - Password: `recruit123` or `coord123`

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/authService.js` - Added `ownerLogin()` method, updated validation
2. `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Added `ownerLogin` to context
3. `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Added owner redirect logic
4. `src/pages/OwnerLogin.jsx` - Uses `ownerLogin()`, added non-owner redirect
5. `src/pages/MemberLogin.jsx` - Added owner redirect logic

## Implementation Complete ✅

The portal isolation is now fully implemented. Owners can only log in through `/owner/login`, and attempting to use other portals will show appropriate error messages and redirect them to the correct portal.
