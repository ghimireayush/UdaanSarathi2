# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a unified language switching system that synchronizes language preferences across all pages in the UdaanSarathi application. The system ensures that when a user changes the language on any page, the preference is maintained across all other pages, and all content is dynamically loaded from JSON translation files instead of hardcoded text.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language toggle buttons to be synchronized across all pages, so that my language preference is consistent throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes language on /login THEN the language preference SHALL be applied to /login/member, /register, and /dashboard
2. WHEN a user changes language on /login/member THEN the language preference SHALL be applied to /login, /register, and /dashboard
3. WHEN a user changes language on /register THEN the language preference SHALL be applied to /login, /login/member, and /dashboard
4. WHEN a user changes language on /dashboard THEN the language preference SHALL be applied to /login, /login/member, and /register
5. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the selected language SHALL persist across all page transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all pages to reflect my language choice immediately, so that I have a consistent multilingual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN language is changed on any page THEN all other pages (/jobs, /drafts, /applications, /interviews, /workflow, /teammembers, /auditlog, /agencysettings) SHALL automatically update to the selected language
2. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the content SHALL be displayed in their previously selected language
3. WHEN language preference is not set THEN the system SHALL default to English
4. IF a user refreshes any page THEN the language preference SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded text to be replaced with dynamic JSON-based translations, so that the application is fully internationalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying any section title THEN the text SHALL be loaded from JSON translation files
2. WHEN displaying any section tabs THEN the text SHALL be loaded from JSON translation files
3. WHEN displaying any button text THEN the text SHALL be loaded from JSON translation files
4. WHEN displaying any form labels THEN the text SHALL be loaded from JSON translation files
5. IF a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL display the English fallback text
6. WHEN adding new content THEN developers SHALL use translation keys instead of hardcoded text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless switching between Nepali and English languages, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the language toggle is clicked THEN the interface SHALL switch between Nepali and English
2. WHEN switching to Nepali THEN all text SHALL be displayed in Nepali script
3. WHEN switching to English THEN all text SHALL be displayed in English
4. WHEN language is changed THEN the change SHALL be reflected immediately without page reload
5. IF Nepali translation is unavailable for specific content THEN English text SHALL be displayed as fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the language preference to be stored persistently, so that users don't lose their language choice between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the preference SHALL be stored in localStorage
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN their previous language choice SHALL be automatically applied
3. WHEN localStorage is cleared THEN the system SHALL revert to the default language (English)
4. WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN language changes SHALL be synchronized across all tabs
5. IF localStorage is not available THEN the system SHALL use sessionStorage as fallback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized translation management system, so that translations can be easily maintained and updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new translations THEN they SHALL be organized by page and component structure
2. WHEN updating translations THEN changes SHALL be reflected across all relevant pages
3. WHEN a translation file is modified THEN the system SHALL load the updated translations
4. IF a translation file has syntax errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and use fallback translations
5. WHEN organizing translations THEN common elements SHALL be stored in shared translation files
