# Error Handling Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fix for the "Identifier 'error' has already been declared" error in the Jobs.jsx component.

## Issue

The error occurred because:
1. The Jobs.jsx component was updated to use the new [useErrorHandler](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\hooks\useErrorHandler.js#L7-L58) hook which provides an [error](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\components\ToastProvider.jsx#L37-L37) variable
2. The component still had its own local state variable `const [error, setError] = useState(null)`
3. This created a naming conflict where [error](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\components\ToastProvider.jsx#L37-L37) was declared twice in the same scope

## Fix

The fix involved two changes to [src/pages/Jobs.jsx](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\pages\Jobs.jsx):

1. **Removed the duplicate error state declaration**:
   ```javascript
   // Removed this line:
   const [error, setError] = useState(null)
   ```

2. **Updated the retry logic to use clearError() instead of setError(null)**:
   ```javascript
   // Changed this:
   setError(null)
   
   // To this:
   clearError()
   ```

## Result

The component now:
1. Uses only the [error](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\components\ToastProvider.jsx#L37-L37) variable from the [useErrorHandler](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\hooks\useErrorHandler.js#L7-L58) hook
2. Properly clears errors using the [clearError](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\hooks\useErrorHandler.js#L47-L50) function from the hook
3. No longer has naming conflicts
4. Maintains all the improved error handling functionality

## Verification

The fix has been implemented and the component should now compile without the "Identifier 'error' has already been declared" error.

## Additional Notes

No other components were affected by this issue since the [useErrorHandler](file://d:\ph\udaan\src\hooks\useErrorHandler.js#L7-L58) hook was only added to the Jobs.jsx component. Other components that have their own error state variables do not use the hook yet.
